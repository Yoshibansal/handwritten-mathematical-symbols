Context
HASYv2 - Handwritten Symbol database

Content
HASY contains 32px x 32px images of 369 symbol classes. In total, HASY contains over 150,000 instances of handwritten symbols.

This is basically a multiclass classification problem which I solved using CNN followed by Max pooling and dense layers.
